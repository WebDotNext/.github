## Tomorrows Innovation, Today

I help companies design, build, and scale distributed systems — from cloud-native architectures to blockchain infrastructure.

## What I Do

**Platform Engineering** — Event-driven architectures, microservices, and distributed systems that handle real-world scale. I've built Virtual Power Plants, mass communications systems, and high-throughput gaming platforms.

**Blockchain Development** — Smart contracts, DeFi tooling, and on-chain automation. Solana, EVM chains, and protocol integrations.

**Technical Leadership** — Embedded tech lead for teams that need senior engineering firepower without the permanent headcount. Architecture reviews, performance optimization, and mentoring.
